### Hello! ðŸ’«

I'm Xenia (he/him), and I'm a Junior College student.

I'm currently focusing on my studies, but enjoy coding when I have time. I sometimes do web development (React) and helped develop a Discord bot (Python). I've also joined a couple of CTFs, though I'm still a noob lol

Here's a picture of my school's fat cat for your viewing pleasure:
